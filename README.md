	• Written for Processing.
	• A fractal fern can be generated with 4 basic transformations.
	• Changing 2 constants can alter the fern to model multiple species.
	• The coordinates of the mouse are used to manipulate the constants and, in turn, the shape of the fern.
	• Submitted for a tiny code competition.
	• Won 1st place at KTByte Fall 1k Tiny Code Contest.
